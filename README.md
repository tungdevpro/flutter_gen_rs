## Flutter Gen RS


Just a little knowledge about Rust, but over time it's beneficial for me -_-

Yeh, below here, there are some features (done, doing) 

- [x] Generate a bloc file
- [ ] Generate an event file
- [ ] Generate a state file

1. Clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tungdevpro/flutter_gen_rs.git

```
